# Hallway SDK License Agreement

**Last updated: April 29, 2022**

Version 1.0

This Hallway SDK License Agreement, ("Agreement"), is a binding
agreement between you and QuarkWorks Inc., a California corporation
and its affiliates (collectively "QuarkWorks", "Hallway", "Hallway
Tile", “we”, “us” or "our") governing your use of our Hallway Software
Development Kit (SDK). Hallway SDK means any SDK, including our
AvatarWebKit SDK and any application programming interfaces, plugins,
code, technology, tools documentation, specification and content made
available by us to others (collectively, the “SDK”).

The SDK and other products offered by Hallway are considered
intellectual property, as defined below and marked as assets
of Hallway (“Assets”). If you, as a third party (“Provider”)
through your Application, as defined below, offer and distribute
Assets and an end-user (“End-User”) acquires a license to an Asset
from us, this License Agreement shall apply regardless of whether
the asset is produced by us or by you, as a Provider and licensor.

Your use is expressly conditioned on your acceptance of the Agreement
contained herein. By accepting, you are agreeing with other applicable
terms and conditions of Hallway and QuarkWorks, Inc., our [SDK Terms
of Service](https://joinhallway.com/legal/sdk/terms-of-service) and acknowledging our [Privacy Policy](https://joinhallway.com/legal/sdk/privacy-policy/).
This Agreement, the Terms of Service, and the Privacy Policy are,
collectively, the “Terms”. The SDK is protected by copyright laws and
international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual
property laws and treaties. The SDK is licensed (not sold).

### License

Subject to these Terms, you are granted a limited, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, revocable
right and license to use and reproduce the SDK solely to develop,
test or distribute your Application (defined below) and to enable you
and/or your end user access to Hallway features, including but not
limited to, facial, hand and body tracking technology; and blend shape and
animation data streaming over OSC, TCP/UDP, Sockets, WebRTC, etc.

The license granted is solely for the purpose of testing, developing
and promoting your applications, content, games, demos or other products
and features (“Application") and providing end users access to Hallway
features and services through your Application.

The SDK may include sample source code, libraries or other materials
for incorporation into your Application. The SDK may include materials
that you may display to your end users, including avatars, items, props
and backgrounds. The SDK documentation will indicate such use and you
may incorporate, reproduce and distribute them as part of your Application.

You may, but are under no obligation to, allow Hallway access to the
pre-release versions of your Applications.

### End User License

If an End User acquires a license to an Asset that is distributed by you,
as a Provider, then you shall be considered as the seller of the license
to such Asset. In such a case, only you, as the Provider (as opposed to
Hallway), shall be responsible for any liability under any End User
license agreement or any breach by the Provider. End Users may use the
licensed Assets only for their intended purpose and only under the same
or more restrictive conditions than applicable under this Agreement.

### Intellectual property rights

You understand and agree that Hallway and its suppliers retain all
legal rights, title and interest (to include but not limited to patent,
copyright, trademark, trade secret and moral rights) globally to any
intellectual property included in the SDK, including, without limitation,
all copyrights and other intellectual property rights therein.
You may not use, copy, or distribute the SDK without authorization.
All rights are reserved. You are expressly prohibited from:

(a) modifying, creating derivative works of, reverse engineering, reverse
compiling, or disassembling the SDK;

(b) distributing, selling, leasing, renting, lending, assigning or
sublicensing any part of the SDK to any third party except as expressly
provided herein and as necessary to distribute any Applications;

(c) using the SDK to create Applications that act as "virtual cameras" on
the devices of end users;

(d) using the SDK to upload or otherwise transmit any material
containing SDK viruses or other computer code, files or programs designed
to interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any SDK or hardware;

(e) using the SDK or your Application in any way that violates the rights
of Hallway or third parties or applicable laws governing import,
export and privacy;

(f) using or distributing the SDK in any manner that would cause
the SDK or any part thereof, or Hallway, to become subject to the terms
of any open source license or any other restriction. In addition,
you may not represent that the Applications are certified or otherwise
endorsed by Hallway, and you may not use the Hallway name
or any other trademarks or service marks of Hallway in connection
with the Applications.

### Feedback

You, but not your users, may provide Hallway with feedback on the SDK
including, without limitation, feedback on bugs and faults within
or relating to the SDK, or suggestions for improvements or other changes
to all or any portion of the SDK. You agree that Hallway shall own
all feedback, ideas, concepts and changes to any portion of the SDK
developed or identified in the course of or as a result of your use
of the SDK and all associated intellectual property rights
(“Feedback Results”), and you hereby assign to Hallway all of your right,
title and interest thereto. You will not knowingly provide Feedback
Results that are subject to third party intellectual property rights.
You agree to cooperate fully and to ensure that your employees, officers,
independent contractors cooperate fully with Hallway with respect
to signing further documents and doing such other acts as are reasonably
requested by Hallway to confirm that Hallway owns the Feedback Results,
and to enable Hallway to register and/or protect any associated
intellectual property rights and/or confidential information.

### Confidentiality

Our communication with you and the SDK may contain confidential
and proprietary information of Hallway which includes information
that is marked confidential or that would normally be considered
confidential under the circumstances (“Confidential Information”).

Confidential Information does not include information:

(a) that is or becomes public knowledge or is received by either party
without any breach of any confidentiality obligation;

(b) that the receiving party can document was independently developed
without use or access to the Confidential Information; or

(c) that the receiving party can document was previously known prior
to receipt of the Confidential Information.

You agree not to disclose any Confidential Information you may receive
to any third party without our prior written consent. You agree that
any unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information would cause
irreparable harm and that in the event of any breach or threatened
breach of the above confidentiality obligations, Hallway shall be
entitled to obtain equitable relief in addition to any other remedy.

### Support

Hallway may, but is under no obligation to provide any support for the SDK.

### Privacy

You represent and warrant that you have provided clear notice to users
regarding data processing that includes third parties and Hallway
and its affiliates, who may collect or receive information from your
Application. You agree to comply with all applicable privacy and data
protection laws as well as our applicable Privacy Policy which constitutes
part of the Terms of this Agreement.

### Termination

The terms of this Agreement begin when you check "Agree" under Terms in
the Hallway SDK Application form, or when you download or use the SDK or
any part of it, and will continue until terminated as set out in the
Agreement. The Confidentiality, Indemnification, Warranty Disclaimer,
Limitation of Liability, and Miscellaneous sections set out in this
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Hallway
may terminate this Agreement or suspend the SDK or any portion or
feature or your access thereto if you breach any material provision of
this Agreement or the Terms without liability to you or any obligation
to you. In the event that the SDK is discontinued or Hallway ceases to
exist, this Agreement and the SDK, including any backend infrastructure
and support, may terminate automatically and without notice to you.

Upon termination, you agree to immediately stop using, distributing
or making available the SDK and all Applications that incorporate
the SDK or any of its components. You must destroy or return any
stored or cached content, software or other materials in connection
with the SDK.

EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE USE OF THE SDK TO THE MAXIMUM

WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
OR NONINFRINGEMENT OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SDK WILL BE ACCURATE,
FREE OF ERRORS OR DEFECTS, FREE OF VIRUSES OR CONTAMINATION,
UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.

THE SDK IS PROVIDED “AS-IS”. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR
USE OF THE SDK. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY DAMAGE RESULTING
FROM THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OR COMPILED BY THE SDK. YOU ASSUME
ALL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SELECTION OF THE SDK TO ACHIEVE
YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF,
AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SDK. YOUR SOLE REMEDY AGAINST Hallway
FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SDK OR FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED THEREBY
IS TO STOP USING SUCH SDK. THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART
OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

YOU AGREE NOT TO TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION OR MAKE ANY CLAIM AGAINST Hallway
OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS IN RELATION TO THE SDK AND/OR YOUR USAGE THEREOF.
FURTHERMORE, YOU AGREE NOT TO SUPPORT ANY SUCH ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BY

THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR
AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOW BY HIM OR HER MUST
HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL COMPANY’S TOTAL
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES IN ANY ONE OR MORE CAUSE OF ACTION
EXCEED \$50. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FAILURE
OF ANY ESSENTIAL REMEDY.

### INDEMNITY

Any dispute between you and Company regarding this Agreement will be
subject to the exclusive venue of the state and federal courts
in the Western District of Missouri.

### Waiver

No delay or failure to take action under this Agreement will constitute
a waiver unless expressly waived in writing, signed by a duly authorized
Hallway representative, and no single waiver will constitute
a continuing or subsequent waiver. If any provision is found to be
unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated
to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise
remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to your use of the SDK.

### Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by
a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of the
Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and the provision
affected will be construed so as to be enforceable to the
maximum extent permissible by law.

### Changes to the agreement

Hallway shall have the right to unilaterally change or add to the terms
of this Agreement at any time upon notice by any means Hallway determines
in its discretion to be reasonable and may simply reference a posted,
newly revised version of the Agreement on its website. It is your
responsibility to review the most updated version thereof.

By continuing to use the SDK following such modifications, you agree
to be bound by such modifications. If you do not agree with the updated
terms, do not use or access the SDK. Your compliance with the terms
of the updates cannot be avoided by using an older release of the SDK.
